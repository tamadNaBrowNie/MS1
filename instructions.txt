Sir, run schema.sql in DB folder in a MySQL connection. Creates a schema called ms1. Please start a virtual environment then go to the directory of project. Please install requirements using requirements.txt. Enter MS1 subdirectory. Edit settings.py. Set 'HOST' to host of connection and 'PORT' to its port. 'USER' is user with sufficient crud access to the db ms1. 'PASSWORD' is password of 'USER'. DO NOT CHANGE THE 'NAME' or 'ENGINE'. create certifacte and its key. Start server with  `python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file <your certificate> --key-file <certificate key file>`. If it fails, try installing pipenv first then run pipenv in the project directory with `pipenv shell`. Install the stuff in requirements.txt with pipenv. Finally runserver with the 
manage.py again.
