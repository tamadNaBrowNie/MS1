Sir, run schema.sql in DB folder in a MySQL connection. Creates a schema called ms1. Please start a virtual 
environment then go to the directory of project. Please install the requirements from requirements.txt. Enter 
MS1 subdirectory. Edit settings.py. Set 'HOST' to the host of the connection and 'PORT' to its port. The 'USER' 
should be a user that can has sufficient crud access to the db ms1. 'PASSWORD' is the password of that user. DO 
NOT CHANGE THE 'NAME' or 'ENGINE'. The server is runnable using manage.py. Try `python manage.py runserver`. If 
it fails, try installing pipenv first then run pipenv in the project directory with `pipenv shell`. Install the 
stuff in requirements.txt with pipenv. Finally runserver with the manage.py again.
