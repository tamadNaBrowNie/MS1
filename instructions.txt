Sir, run the schema.sql in a MySQL connection. It should create a schema called ms1 in the server. Then please 
start a virtual environment then go to the directory where the extracted project is. Please install the 
requirements in the requirements.txt. Go to the MS1 subdirectory. Look for settings.py then edit it. Set 'HOST' 
to the host of the connection and 'PORT' to its port. The 'USER' should be a user that can has sufficient crud 
access to the db ms1. 'PASSWORD' is the password of that user. DO NOT CHANGE THE 'NAME' or 'ENGINE'. The server 
is runnable using manage.py. Try `python manage.py runserver`. If it fails, try installing pipenv first then 
run pipenv in the project directory with `pipenv shell`. Install the stuff in requirements.txt with pipenv. 
Finally runserver with the manage.py again.
